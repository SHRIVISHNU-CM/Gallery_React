Built using React.js, Daisy UI, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB,Multer, and Cloudinary, Gallery is a full stack project. I gained an understanding of MulterÂ and cloudinary from this project. Multer is a middleware for Node.js that manages file uploads.Â Secure API uploading of media files from the server side to the browser is offered by Cloudinary.
